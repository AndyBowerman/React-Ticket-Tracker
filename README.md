# Ticket Tracker Application

Allows users to track how many tickets they have taken whilst also displaying other users and how many trackers they have.
Tickets can be added as users take on more work and reduced as they complete tickets

# Add User Feature

When the add user button is selected users can enter a new employee's name and job title to create a new employee.
This is done by adding a new user object to the team array and rerendering the data.

# Search User Feature

You can filter the team array by job title and name to search for specific employees or roles.

# Improvements

After searching through employees you cannot reset the to see all staff members without losing those that
were added.
I've used multiple buttons and should have rendered this as a reusable component.
